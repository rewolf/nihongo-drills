日本語 (Nihongo) Drills
=======================

A small website that helps a beginner with recognition of Kana characters.  
I built in late 2011 when I began studying Japanese. 


This site is built purely with
* PHP
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

There's no use of jQuery other libraries because at the time of writing this I preferred to code everything myself.
