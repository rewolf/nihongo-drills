日本語 (Nihongo) Drills
=======================
http://www.nihongodrills.com

A small website that helps a beginner with recognition of Kana characters.  I built it in late 2011 when I began studying Japanese. 

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpRdNymaGC8) on how to use the website for studying.


This site is built purely with
* PHP
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

There's no use of jQuery other libraries because at the time of writing this I preferred to code everything myself.
