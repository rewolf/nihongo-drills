		This drill plays an audio clip of a random japanese syllable/sound.  On a piece of paper or the canvas provided below, you must attempt to write the character corresponding the sound you hear. Once you have drawn it, click the <i>Show</i> to see if you were correct. The settings to the right can be used to use Google's alternate audio voice or to limit the range of characters being tested.
