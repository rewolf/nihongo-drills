	<h1>Pronounce this hiragana character</h1>
	<p class="drill-instruction">
		This drill displays random characters which you must pronounce just like the common flash-card programs.  You can check if you were correct by clicking the <i>play</i> button.  The settings to the right can be used to automate the <i>playing</i>/<i>reading</i> and the changing to the next character as if someone was showing you flash-cards at regular intervals.
