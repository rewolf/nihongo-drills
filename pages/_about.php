		About this site.. 
	</h3>
	<p>
		There are plenty of books, audio CDs and online resources that teach the Japanese language.
		The aim of this site is not to teach but to provide repetitive drills, or tests,  to help you
		memorise the fundamentals of the language, namely, the hiragana characters.
	</p>
	<p>
		This site aims to avoid the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese">r≈çmaji characters</a> so that the learner's brain
		forms direct associations between sounds/syllables and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">hiragana characters</a> rather than
		wasting time converting to/from the romanization.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the audio clips may not pronounce the characters/words correctly, but are good
		enough to understand and distinguish.  Google's pronunciation is provided as an alternative.
	</p>
	<p>
		I, myself, am still learning Japanese and this site is the evolution of something I
		made to drill myself.  If you have any ideas, complaints or requests for drills, let me know via
		<a href="mailto:feedback@nihongodrills.com">feedback@nihongodrills.com</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nihongo_drills" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
